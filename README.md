## Build

To install all the necessary dependencies for the example you'll need to run the following commands:

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli && npm install && grunt bootstrap
```

If you have problems with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) you may need to [uninstall a previously installed version](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), you may also need to run the `grunt-cli` installation using `sudo`.

This will ensure that all of the necessary node and bower modules are installed, documentation is built, and the example has been bootstrapped.

## Web Server for the Example Application

You can run the test server with the following command:

```
$ grunt server
```

## Tests

It is important that you have already run the `grunt bootstrap` task before testing.

```
grunt test
```

### Unit

```
grunt test:unit
```

### End to End

```
grunt test:e2e
```

### Continuous Integration Unit

```
grunt cont:unit
```

### Continuous Integration e2e
